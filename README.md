# Correlation Analysis

This repository focuses on correlation analysis and includes the following components:

## Scatterplot Matrix

- **Visualization**: Provides a scatterplot matrix for multiple quantitative datasets derived from a single dataset. This matrix helps in understanding the relationships between variables.

## Correlation Matrix

- **Numerical and Visual Representations**: Displays both numerical values and visual representations (circles/squares) of correlation coefficients.
- **Correlation Graph**: Includes a graph representation of the correlations if possible.

## Correlation Coefficients

- **Calculation**: Computes Pearson, Spearman, or Kendall correlation coefficients for significant correlations.
- **Statistical Significance Testing**: Includes methods for testing the statistical significance of the correlations.
- **Interpretation**: Provides interpretation of the results to understand the relationships and dependencies between variables.
